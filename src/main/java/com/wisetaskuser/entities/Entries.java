/**
 * A class containing a list of entries as its only field.
 * @author Theofanis Gkoufas
 * 
 * Having this bean class, as well as its dependency (list) with a scope of "prototype",
 * means that when we request such an object (bean) from the spring factory, spring always creates 
 * a new object and returns to us a reference of that object.
 * Prior to this change, the scope was "singleton" (which is the default one). This created a problem
 * when it came to the entries list. Meaning that whenever I retrieved data from the database they were
 * added to that list, but then when retrieving a second time, the data from the previous request would
 * also be transported (so we retrieved the data twice etc.). The problem was that the elements of the 
 * list were never removed and since the object had a singleton scope, every time that I wanted to use
 * that bean, spring would return to me a reference to the same object (with the same unchanged list).
 * So by changing the respective scopes the problem was fixed.
